In the past, many players were requesting for the new vehicle in the game and prioritizing their feedbacks; the developers have finally initiated it.  \n \nThe good news is that since the motorcycle is small, you can move faster and pass through narrow places without many problems.")

If you want to explore on small islands or similar places, don’t worry, because you can return to the main terrain without being exposed by the connecting bridge.
